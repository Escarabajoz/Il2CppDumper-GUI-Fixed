# Security Patches Applied to Il2CppDumper

## Overview
This document outlines all security vulnerabilities that were identified and patched in the Il2CppDumper application.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Path Traversal in ZIP Extraction (CRITICAL)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Utils/ZipUtils.cs`
**Issue:** ZIP entries could contain malicious paths like `../../../etc/passwd` allowing attackers to write files outside the intended directory.
**Fix:** 
- Added path sanitization and validation
- Implemented path traversal detection
- Added file size limits and extraction count limits
- Created `ExtractArchiveSafely` method for comprehensive protection

### 2. Insecure JSON Deserialization (CRITICAL)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`
**Issue:** Direct deserialization of config files without validation could lead to code execution.
**Fix:**
- Created `SecureConfigLoader` utility class
- Added file size validation
- Implemented safe JSON deserialization with System.Text.Json
- Added configuration validation

### 3. Insecure Network Communication (HIGH)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`
**Issue:** WebClient usage without proper SSL validation or timeouts.
**Fix:**
- Created `SecureHttpClient` utility class
- Added SSL certificate validation
- Implemented request timeouts
- Added response content validation

### 4. Input Validation Issues (HIGH)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`
**Issue:** Direct use of `Convert.ToUInt64` without proper error handling.
**Fix:**
- Created `InputValidator` utility class
- Added safe hex address parsing
- Implemented comprehensive input validation
- Added path validation methods

### 5. Insecure Process Execution (HIGH)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`
**Issue:** Process.Start calls with user-controlled input without validation.
**Fix:**
- Added URL validation before opening links
- Implemented safe process execution with proper error handling
- Disabled shell execution where possible

## High Impact Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 6. Zip Bomb Protection (CRITICAL)
**Files:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`, `Il2CppDumper/Utils/ZipUtils.cs`
**Issue:** No protection against zip bombs or resource exhaustion attacks.
**Fix:**
- Added file count limits (max 10,000 files)
- Added total extraction size limits (max 500MB)
- Added individual file size limits (max 100MB)
- Pre-validation of archives before extraction

### 7. Unsafe Directory Operations (HIGH)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`
**Issue:** Recursive directory deletion without safety checks.
**Fix:**
- Created `SecureDirectoryOperations` utility class
- Added path validation before deletion
- Implemented system directory protection
- Added safe directory creation methods

### 8. Information Disclosure in Logs (MEDIUM)
**File:** `Il2CppDumper/Forms/MainForm.xaml.cs`
**Issue:** Sensitive information like memory addresses logged without sanitization.
**Fix:**
- Added log message sanitization
- Implemented sensitive data pattern removal
- Added log message length limits

## New Security Utility Classes Created

### 1. SecureConfigLoader.cs
- Safe JSON configuration loading
- File size validation
- Configuration value validation
- Proper error handling

### 2. SecureHttpClient.cs
- HTTPS-only communication
- SSL certificate validation
- Request timeouts
- Response content validation

### 3. InputValidator.cs
- Hex address parsing
- Path validation
- URL validation
- Version string validation
- Log message sanitization

### 4. SecureDirectoryOperations.cs
- Safe directory deletion
- System directory protection
- Path validation
- Safe directory creation

## Security Configuration

### File Size Limits
- Config files: 1MB maximum
- Individual ZIP entries: 100MB maximum
- Total ZIP extraction: 500MB maximum
- Log messages: 500 characters maximum

### Network Security
- HTTPS required for all network communications
- 10-second timeout for HTTP requests
- Certificate validation enabled
- Response size validation

### Path Security
- Path traversal detection and prevention
- System directory protection
- Invalid character filtering
- Filename length limits (255 characters)

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing
1. **Path Traversal Testing:** Test with ZIP files containing `../` sequences
2. **Zip Bomb Testing:** Test with compressed files that expand to large sizes
3. **Input Validation Testing:** Test with malformed hex addresses and invalid paths
4. **Network Security Testing:** Test with invalid SSL certificates
5. **Process Execution Testing:** Test with malicious URLs and paths

### Functional Testing
1. Verify all existing functionality still works
2. Test configuration loading and saving
3. Test ZIP extraction for valid files
4. Test network update checking
5. Test directory operations

## Deployment Notes

### Required Dependencies
- System.Text.Json (for secure JSON handling)
- Existing dependencies remain unchanged

### Configuration Changes
- Config files are now validated before loading
- Invalid configurations fall back to defaults
- Configuration errors are logged but don't crash the application

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Configuration files remain compatible
- User interface unchanged

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Security Logging
- All security-related events are logged
- Failed validation attempts are recorded
- Path traversal attempts are logged and blocked

### Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for new security vulnerabilities
- Review security logs regularly
